# theRedditScrapeForProgrammers
A website that scrapes Reddit to find the best articles about all sorts of programming languages, architectures, and practices, along with a funny one or two!  This site uses Express.js, Mongo.js, Axios.js, &amp; Cheerio.js to scrape the site and create a dynamic front-end that allows you to filter throughout the posts, save your favorites, and add comments for you to come back to later.
